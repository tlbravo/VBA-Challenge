*This is the Module 2 Challenge. I used VBA scripting to analyze generated stock market data with the data provided in the alphbetical_testing and Multiple_year_stock_data spreadsheets.
I used the following website for tips and examples on how to use VBA: https://www.automateexcel.com/vba-code-examples/.
I googled the max function for vba and used this website: https://www.educba.com/vba-max/ and applied the concept to Greatest % Increase, Greatest % Decrease, and Greatest Total Volume 

Instructions
Create a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information: The ticker symbol, yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year, the percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year, and the total stock volume of the stock. 

Add functionality to the script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume".

Make the appropriate adjustments to the VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every year) at once.

NOTE
Make sure to use conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

Other Considerations
Use the sheet alphabetical_testing.xlsx while developing the code. This dataset is smaller and will allow me to test faster. The code should run on this file in under 3 to 5 minutes.

Make sure that the script acts the same on every sheet. 

*The VB script and screenshots of my work are included.
